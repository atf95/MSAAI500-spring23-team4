Project Intro/Objective

The main purpose of this project is to pick and analyze a data set from the UCI machine learning repository. A collection of Bach chorales was chosen, including features the features pitch, duration, key signature, time signature, and fermata for 100 chorales. Exploratory data analysis was completed before evaluating models to predict key signature based on proportions of note durations.
